# Data Warehouse Analytics – SQL Exploration Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on *exploring and analyzing a data warehouse* using SQL Server.  
The goal is to understand the structure of the warehouse, explore dimensions and facts, and answer key business questions using analytical SQL queries.

### SQL File Breakdown
| File Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 01_database_exploration.sql | Explore schemas, tables, and column metadata |
| 02_dimension_exploration.sql | Analyze customer and product dimensions |
| 03_date_exploration.sql | Identify time range and date coverage |
| 04_measure_analysis.sql | Calculate key business KPIs |
| 05_magnitude_analysis.sql | Analyze distribution across customers, products, and categories |
| 06_ranking_analysis.sql | Identify top and bottom performers |

The warehouse follows a *star schema* with:
- *Fact table*: gold.fact_sales
- *Dimension tables*:  
  - gold.dim_customers  
  - gold.dim_products

All queries were executed using *SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)*.

## 1. Database Exploration
*Objective:* Understand the database structure.

### Tasks Performed
- Listed all tables in the database
- Explored column-level metadata for specific tables

### Key Learnings
- Used INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES to identify available objects
- Used INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to understand table structures

---

## 2. Dimension Exploration
*Objective:* Explore descriptive attributes in dimension tables.

### Customer Dimension (gold.dim_customers)
- Identified distinct customer countries
- Analyzed customer distribution by country and gender
- Determined youngest and oldest customers using birthdates

### Product Dimension (gold.dim_products)
- Explored product hierarchy (category, subcategory, product name)
- Analyzed product counts by category
- Calculated average product cost per category

---

## 3. Date & Time Exploration
*Objective:* Understand the sales timeline.

### Analysis Performed
- Identified first and last order dates
- Calculated total number of years of sales data available

### Insights
- Helped define the historical coverage of the dataset
- Useful for time-based trend analysis

---

## 4. Measure Exploration (Key Business Metrics)
*Objective:* Generate high-level KPIs.

### Metrics Calculated
- Total Sales
- Total Quantity Sold
- Average Price
- Total Number of Orders
- Total Number of Products
- Total Number of Customers

### Approach
- Used UNION ALL to consolidate multiple KPIs into a single report-style output

---

## 5. Magnitude Analysis
*Objective:* Understand scale and distribution.

### Analysis Performed
- Total customers by country
- Total customers by gender
- Total products by category
- Total revenue generated by each category
- Total revenue generated by each customer
- Distribution of sold items across countries

### SQL Techniques Used
- GROUP BY
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Joins between fact and dimension tables

---

## 6. Ranking Analysis
*Objective:* Identify top and bottom performers.

### Analysis Performed
- Top 5 products by revenue
- Bottom 5 products by revenue
- Top 10 customers by total revenue
- Customers with the fewest orders

### SQL Techniques Used
- Window functions (DENSE_RANK)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Parameterized ranking logic

---

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- Star schema analytics
- Fact vs Dimension modeling
- Aggregate functions
- Window functions
- Joins (INNER & LEFT JOIN)
- CTEs
- Business-focused analytical queries

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL
